This is a application I threw together for some friends back in early 2013.
What the app did was it was a widget when added it would pop-up a configuration utility app. This application would allow you to select a contact from your phone, one of their phone numbers, and how often you needed to call them. After being selected it would then create the widget which would count down each day and once the timer got to zero it would change to showing "Call Now" and with one tap you could call that contact.
I made this as several people at the office were upset that the "Call Mom" widget which was bundled with early HTC devices got taken away. 

It unfortunately hasn't kept up with the times. The way widgetid's are handled now seems a bit different and as such the app now acts oddly for about 30 seconds after being added and then will become stable.
