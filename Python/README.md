I haven't done a lot so far in python. What I have mainly made in the past were little Linux scripts used in backing up data, manipulating excel files and csv's.
I have got one project already on GitHub though which contains some of my Python Code.

https://github.com/mortalglitch/Social-Art-Feed

The Social-Art-Feed connects to Twitter and pulls the information, based on certain search criteria, to build a webpage out of the results.
I have an example of this project at:

This one is currently frozen(won't update every 5 minutes like normal) as the RaspberryPi server I was using it currently occupied with another task.
